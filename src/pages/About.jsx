            The Journey of a Lifelong Learner
          </h1>
          <p className="text-base font-normal mb-3 text-justify">
            My story began with a fascination for technology and an endless
            curiosity to understand how things work. I spent countless nights
            teaching myself to code, driven by a passion for solving problems
            and the joy of creating something out of nothing. It was this love
            for learning that laid the foundation for my journey as a
            programmer.
          </p>
          <p className="text-base font-normal mb-3 text-justify">
            My journey as a programmer is far from over. Iâ€™m still that curious
            learner, excited by every new challenge, and eager to see where this
            path will lead next.
